## What's a conditional?

a = 2 
b = 2

if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")


## Types of conditionals : 

# if
# elif
# else

a = 2
b = 3

#------------------#
if a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif b  == (a + 100):
    print("b is equal to a plus 100")
# conditional AND not the conditional above it
else:
    print("b is greater than a")
